<h1>1.2 Introduce Yourself and/or Your Passion</h1>

<p>
    ZhihanLi's portfolio website is an portfolio website offering informations related to myself, including education background, work experience, project experience, etc. Unlike other portfolio websites, which provide personal information and projects only, my portfolio site will highly encourage visiters to contact me. 
    <br> In this website, I will put my personal information, my resume, all of my experiences and projects as many as possible in it so that my visiters will have a comprehensive understanding of me and my ability level. I will also put my contact info in my porfolio website so that anyone have an interest in me will send me a message. Therefore, there are totally 5 main pages in my website: Home, About, Project, Resume, and Contact. In the Home page, I will show the most important elements and the stuff I want to hightlight. In the About pages, I will introduce my background, my certificates, and my experience most. In the project page, my projects will be shown one after another with abundant images, introductions, as well as links. In the Resume page, an pdf will be shown and avaliable to be downloaded. In the end, in Contact page, people are available to send message to me through a form. In addition, I will put sourceLog and siteMap in footer. <br> Following are some missions for my website so far:
