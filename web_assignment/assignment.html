    <b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b>
  </h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
    <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
    delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
    mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
    differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
    better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
    look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
    might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
    it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
    it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
    style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
    assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
    <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>
